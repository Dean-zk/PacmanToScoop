# PacmanToScoop

A silly little project where I added the syntax of Pacman (Arch linux package manager) to the scoop package manager.

# How to use it?

Copy the code into your $PROFILE

```bash
notepad $PROFILE
```
If you don't have this file then enter this command:

```bash
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```

Enjoy using the syntax of pacman with the power of scoop!
