# PacmanToScoop

A silly little project where I added the syntax of Pacman (Arch linux package manager) to the scoop package manager.

# How to use it?

Copy the code into your $PROFILE

```bash
notepad $PROFILE
```
If you don't have this file then enter this command:

```bash
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```
# Next Push:
- "-Syu" will allow a package after it. Meaning you can update your scoop packages and install one at the same time.
- Creating some of my own flags that will be efficient to use.
- Adding more functionality to scoop with this funny project.
  
Enjoy using the syntax of pacman with the power of scoop!
